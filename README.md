Introduction
------------
- [Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for numerical computing (quoted from the site).
- This directory contains some examples of the Julia scripts to get a picture of what the Julia language is.
- Note that these scripts are for demonstation and understanding the Julia language.  I cannot ensure any mathematical correctness or efficiency.
- These scripts are confirmed on Julia: Version 1.5.0-DEV.338 Commit ef0e0f2923 (2020-02-24 22:36 UTC)
