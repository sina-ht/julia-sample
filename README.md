Introduction
------------
- [Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for numerical computing (quoted from the site).
- This directory contains some examples of the Julia scripts to get a picture of what the Julia language is.
- Note that these scripts are for demonstation and understanding the Julia language.  I cannot ensure any mathematical correctness or efficiency.
- These scripts are confirmed on Julia: Version 0.7.0-DEV.4456 Commit 05ff71f187 (2018-03-03 01:29 UTC)
