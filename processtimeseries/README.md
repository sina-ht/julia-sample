Process a time series data
==========================

Mainly, we'd like to use TimeSeries package, but we must create TimeArray
for the package from various data source. This sample provides, I think, a
typical processing example.

Originally, I wrote this code for my actual health data. But I don't want to
include this publication, so I included a random data for example. You could
adjust the convert process to your data format with the help of this example.
